In the head section I used meta tags and favicons for better visual represantion of th website on messengers and social media. 
For the body I stick to the semantic tags to create logical blocks of the website. All the scripts and libraries I placed in the end of the body so they don't disrubt the code loading.

As for the style, I divided the project into logical components based on the semantic tags. For the base I used mixins and variables for the main colors.

I used a little bit of JavaScript on the "burger" element. It was the first time I implemented event listeners on the DOM elements. I used more advanced JS in my later projects - please check my [To-Do in vanilla JS](https://github.com/irinamiheeva13/Todo-VanillaJs)

For the package management I used gulp. It watches all my files and compile them into the dist folder. 
As for the mail form I used a bit of php code that I learned through a tutorial.
